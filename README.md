# The Tools for Data Science: Notebooks and Versioning
A part of AI4PH's [short courses series](https://ai4ph-hrtp.ca/short-courses/).

## Course Outline
#### Instructor: Farbod Abolhassani
This course provides learners with the necessary skills to work effectively with data science tools, specifically Jupyter Notebooks and versioning systems. Participants will gain a fundamental understanding of how Jupyter Notebooks function as an interactive computational environment for creating, sharing, and documenting code, and how it can be leveraged to analyze large datasets in Public Health. It will also cover version control systems, such as Git and key data science libraries, including pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and matplotlib for data visualization, as well as Anaconda, a popular distribution of Python that includes Jupyter Notebooks and key data science libraries.


## Dataset Used
[Average Ambulance Response Time](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/land-ambulance-response-time-standard-response-times/resource/be860641-c550-47f0-8544-fb56f52114ae)

**Population Estimates, Land Area, Population Density and Average Response Times**

Public posting of legislated response time reports for every upper-tier municipality (UTM) and land ambulance communication service, referred to as ambulance dispatch centres or Central Ambulance Communication Centres (CACCs), as an indicator of land ambulance performance measurement.
